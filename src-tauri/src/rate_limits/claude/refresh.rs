//! Delegated Claude OAuth refresh.
//!
//! When the access token in the keychain is expired we **never**
//! refresh it ourselves. Instead we spawn `claude auth status --json`
//! and let the Claude CLI process do the refresh:
//!
//! - Claude CLI owns the keychain ACL for `Claude Code-credentials`,
//!   so it can read and write that item without prompting.
//! - Claude CLI talks to Anthropic with its own refresh_token, then
//!   writes the new credentials back to the same keychain item.
//! - Winthorpe then re-reads the keychain via `/usr/bin/security` (fast,
//!   no UI) to pick up the fresh tokens.
//!
//! The point of this whole dance: Anthropic rotates `refresh_token`
//! values per OAuth best practice. If Winthorpe refreshed directly using
//! the refresh_token from Claude CLI's keychain, the server would
//! invalidate it and Claude CLI's next run would fail with "please
//! log in again". Routing the refresh through the CLI process keeps
//! Claude CLI's stored credential the authoritative one.
//!
//! Failure mode: if `claude auth status` is missing/slow/non-zero
//! we return an error and the caller surfaces it. We deliberately do
//! NOT fall back to direct refresh — losing one usage-stat tick is
//! fine; corrupting Claude CLI's auth state is not.
